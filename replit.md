# Overview

The Memory Hub is a full-stack digital legacy platform designed to help families preserve and share memories, files, and personal content. It features a FastAPI backend, a Flutter web frontend, and MongoDB for data storage. The platform offers a comprehensive suite of features including personal journaling, secure file storage, a customizable dashboard, robust user management, and advanced social functionalities. Recent expansions include content organization, advanced search, analytics, privacy controls, voice notes, custom categories, emoji reactions, memory templates, two-factor authentication, password reset, geolocation-based features, scheduled posts, and a full suite of family-oriented features including deep genealogy integration. The platform aims to create a rich, secure, and collaborative environment for digital remembrance and legacy building, with a strong focus on GDPR compliance and a modern Material 3 design system.

# System Architecture

## Backend Architecture

**Framework**: FastAPI, utilizing async/await for concurrency.
**API Structure**: RESTful APIs with versioned endpoints (`/api/v1/`), organized into modular feature modules. Authentication is JWT-based with access/refresh tokens and OAuth2 password bearer.
**Authentication & Security**: Bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for token management, and role-based access control (USER/ADMIN).
**Data Models**: Pydantic v2 for request/response validation, custom ObjectId handling, Enum-based privacy levels, and validator decorators. Comprehensive audit logging for GDPR compliance is integrated across all family modules.

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: Flutter, enabling cross-platform web deployment.
**Build System**: Flutter web compiles to JavaScript using the CanvasKit renderer, with service worker integration for offline capabilities.
**Deployment**: The backend serves the compiled Flutter web application alongside its APIs.
**State Management**: Provider-based state management with SharedPreferences persistence for theme/user session data.

## Data Storage

**Database**: MongoDB, accessed via the Motor async driver.
**Collections**: A comprehensive schema supports all platform features including users, memories, files, social interactions, and detailed family-related data (e.g., `family_albums`, `genealogy_persons`, `health_records`).
**File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 object storage for secure, scalable cloud-based file storage with S3-compatible API. Features include presigned URL generation for secure access, file metadata management, and organized storage structure. Legacy local filesystem storage in `uploads/` directory remains available as fallback.
**Indexing Strategy**: Automated database indexing system creates over 30 indexes across 10 collections for performance optimization and GDPR audit logging.

## System Design Choices

**UI/UX Decisions**: Modern Material 3 design system with design tokens (colors, typography, spacing), light/dark theme support, reusable component library, and vibrant gradient color schemes (Indigo, Purple, Pink) with Google Fonts (Inter). Features glassmorphic effects for modern aesthetics. Health records feature a professional medical-themed interface with color-coded record types (Medical Blue #2563EB, Teal Green #14B8A6, Success Green #10B981), smooth animations, grid/list view toggle, and advanced filtering capabilities.
**Feature Specifications**:
- **Admin Panel**: Dashboard with statistics, user management, and activity tracking.
- **Social Features**: User search, follow/unfollow, enhanced profiles, consistent avatar rendering, comments, notifications, activity feeds, and ephemeral "Stories."
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Platform-aware API configuration with robust error handling and CORS support.
- **2FA**: TOTP-based authentication with QR code generation and backup codes.
- **Password Reset**: Secure token-based system with email verification.
- **Privacy & Security**: Granular privacy settings, user blocking, and visibility controls.
- **Geolocation**: Saving favorite places, attaching memories to locations, and browsing nearby places.
- **Scheduled Posts**: Scheduling memories, stories, and updates for future publication.
- **Sharing System**: Universal sharing for all content types with QR codes, password protection, expiration dates, max uses tracking, and access analytics. Security-hardened with 32-character tokens and exact-match validation.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance including data portability (JSON/ZIP export), consent management, right to erasure (30-day grace period), and transparency in data processing. Includes comprehensive audit logging.
- **Family Features**: Collaborative photo albums, aggregated family timeline, shared event calendar, milestone tracking, digital cookbook, time-locked legacy letters, documentation of family traditions, parental controls, visual genealogy tree (5-step wizard with invitation system), medical history tracking (hereditary conditions), and secure document vault.
- **Modular Settings**: Redesigned settings with category cards and dedicated detail screens (Privacy, Security, Content, Account).
